### Exercises: Level 1

1. Declare firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried, year variable and assign value to it and use the typeof operator to check different data types.
```js
let firstName  = 'Abdulrahman'; 
let lastName = 'Gaoba';
let country = 'Yemen';
let city = 'Almahweet';
let age = 24;
let isMarried =false;
let year = 2022;
console.log(typeof(firstName));
console.log(typeof(lastName));
console.log(typeof(country));
console.log(typeof(city));
console.log(typeof(isMarried));
console.log(typeof(year));
```

```js
let AbdulrahmanObject = {
    firstName : "Abdulrahman",
    lastName : 'Gaoba',
    country : 'Yemen',
    city :'Almahweet',
    age : 24,
    isMarried :false,
    year :2022
}

    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.firstName));
    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.lastName));
    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.country));
    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.city));
    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.isMarried));
    console.log(typeof(AbdulrahmanObject.year));
 ```

2. Check if type of '10' is equal to 10
```js
let str = '10';
let num = 10;
console.log(typeof (str) == typeof(num));
```


3. Check if parseInt('9.8') is equal to 10
```js
console.log(parseInt ('9.8') == parseInt(10));
```

4. Boolean value is either true or false.
   1. Write three JavaScript statement which provide truthy value.
```js

        if(x||y||z){
            console.log("This is a truthy value");
        }else{
            console.log("This is a falsy value");
        }
```

    2. Write three JavaScript statement which provide falsy value.
```js    
        let m = false;
        let n = 0;
        let t = NaN;
        let e = "";
        let r = null;
        let q = undefined;
        if(m||n||e||t||r||q){
            console.log("This is a truthy value");
        }else{
            console.log("This is a falsy value");
        }
```

5. Figure out the result of the following comparison expression first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it using console.log()
```js
    console.log(4 > 3)          //true    
    console.log(4 >= 3)         //true
    console.log(4 < 3)          //false
    console.log(4 <= 3)         //false
    console.log(4 == 4)         //true
    console.log(4 === 4)        //true    
    console.log(4 != 4)         //false
    console.log(4 !== 4)        //false    
    console.log(4 != '4')       //false    
    console.log( 4 == '4')      //true    
    console.log( 4 === '4')     //false   
```


   Find the length of python and jargon and make a falsy comparison statement.
```js
    console.log('paython'.length ==  'jargon'.lenght);
```

6. Figure out the result of the following expressions first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it by using console.log()
```js
     console.log(4 > 3 && 10 < 12)              //true                          
     console.log(4 > 3 && 10 > 12)              //false                   
     console.log(4 > 3 || 10 < 12)              //true                   
     console.log(4 > 3 || 10 > 12)              //true                        
     console.log(!(4 > 3))                      //false                      
     console.log(!(4 < 3))                      //true            
     console.log(!(false))                      //true
     console.log(!(4 > 3 && 10 < 12))           //false                
     console.log(!(4 > 3 && 10 > 12))           //true                    
     console.log( !(4 === '4'))                 //true  
```
